## Lists of LINEs with and without each chromatin mark were made using BEDtools like the following:

module load bedtools

#ie To make a list of all L1s with H3K9me3
bedtools intersect -u -a all_L1s_500bpmin.bed -b H3K9me3_narrowPeak.bed >L1s_with_H3K9me3.bed

#ie To make a list of all L1s with any enhancer accociated marks
cat L1s_with_H3K4me1.bed L1s_with_H3K27ac.bed L1s_with_ATAC.bed >temp
bedtools sort -i temp >temp2
bedtools merge -d -1 -i temp2 >temp3
bedtools intersect -u all_L1s_500bpmin.bed -b temp3 >L1s_with_enhMarks.bed

#ie To make a list of all L1s with both H3K9me3 and enhancer associated marks
bedtools intersect -u -a L1s_with_H3K9me3.bed -b L1s_with_enhMarks.bed >L1s_with_H3K9me3_and_enhMarks.bed

#ie To make a list of all L1s with H3K9me3 but no enhancer associated marks
bedtools intersect -v -a L1s_with_H3K9me3.bed -b L1s_with_enhMarks.bed >L1s_with_H3K9me3_butno_enhMarks.bed

## Pipeline for segmenting cells and measuring intensity per cell using ImageJ

#open all three channels as hyperstack

#In 405 channel (DAPI):
# process -> filter -> gaussian blur (radius = 2.00)
# image -> adjust -> threshold
# edit -> selection -> create selection 
# analyze -> tools -> ROI Manager -> Add ROI

#In 488 channel (Wheat Germ Agglutinin):
# process -> noise -> despeckle
# image -> adjust -> threshold
# select roi from 405 channel -> edit -> fill
# select roi from 405 channel -> Delete ROI
# process -> binary -> convert to mask
# process -> binary ->open
# if necessary:process -> binary -> fill holes
# process -> binary -> watershed
# process -> binary -> convert to mask
# analyze -> analyze particles (>30 micron^2, circularity=0-1, add to manager, exclude on edges, include holes)

#In 647 channel:
# select ROI from above
# manually remove ROIs that were incorrectly segmented
# analyze -> measure
